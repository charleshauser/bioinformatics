    "### Arrays, Lists, and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental data structures in any language is the array, yet Python doesn't have a native array data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Principially, an array can be seen like a list with the following differences:\n",
    "* All elements have to be of the same type, i.e. integer, float (real) or complex numbers\n",
    "* The number of elements have to be known a priori, i.e. when the array is created. It can't be changed afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to the array, Python has several other data types that can store a sequence of values. The first one is called a `list` and is entered between square brackets. The second one is a tuple (you are right, strange name), and it is entered with parentheses. The difference is that you can change the values of a list after you create them, and you can not do that with a tuple. Other than that, for now you just need to remember that they exist, and that you *cannot* do math with either lists or tuples. When you do `2 * alist` where `alist` is a list, you don't multiply all values in `alist` with the number 2. What happens is that you create a new list that contains `alist` twice (so it adds them back to back). The same holds for tuples. That can be very useful, but not when your intent is to multiply all values by 2. In the example below, the first value in a list is modified. Try to modify one of the values in `btuple` below and you will see that you get an error message:"

    "A list in Python is just an ordered collection of items which can be of any type. By comparison an array is an ordered collection of items of a single type - so in principle a list is more flexible than an array but it is this flexibility that makes things slightly harder when you want to work with a regular structure. A list is also a dynamic mutable type and this means you can add and delete elements from the list at any time.\n",

    "Lists and tuples are versatile data types in Python. We already used lists without knowing it when we created our first array with the command `array([1,7,2,12])`. What we did is we gave the `array` function one input argument: the list `[1,7,2,12]`, and the `array` function returned a one-dimensional array with those values. Lists and tuples can consist of a sequences of pretty much anything, not just numbers. In the example given below, `alist` contains 5 *things*: the integer 1, the float 20, the word `python`, an array with the values 1,2,3, and finally, the function `len`. The latter means that `alist[4]` is actually the function `len`. That function can be called to determine the length of an array as, for example, `alist[4](alist[3])`. The latter may be a bit confusing, but it is cool behavior if you take the time to think about it."
